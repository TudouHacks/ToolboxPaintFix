# ToolboxPaintFix
Shitty script to fix paintability for Splatoon 3 maps on models broken by Switch Toolbox.

## Use tutorial
- Make sure the paintable mats you use have blitz_paint_type set a "1".
- Drop the model (make sure it's decompressed from .zs) into the script.
- Output will be FixedModel.bfres 
- Compress with zstd (you can use do it via toolbox, Tools->Compression->zstd, it will not break the file again)
